# HoI4 to Stellaris Converter

The legendary work of PTSnoop, now updated for modern Stellaris.

Is this necessary? Probably not, but in case "Prosperous Unification" doesn't accurately describe the years of violent combat in your world: here it is.

### Features:

- Picks out the top few nations after the WW2 peace conferences and gives them their own exoplanet colonies to start from. Bigger / more industrialized countries get better planets.
- Simulates a halfway-plausible timeline between the end of WW2 and the 2200 Stellaris start date. Possible futures include Cold Wars between major powers, nuclear war making Earth uninhabitable, climate change making Earth a bit less hospitable in a few different ways, and/or bureaucratic overhead preventing the UN from expanding outside Sol while the other nations bestride the heavens. Or maybe Earth is perfectly fine and is happily governed by whoever most emphatically won HoI4.
- Supports Vic2-to-HoI4 converted games, including ones that were converted from EU4 and CK3. Karlings in space, anyone?

---

### Known limitations:

- Not particularly well tested, especially on Linux. If you're having issues, send your save game, converter log, and if relevant, your Vic2-to-HoI4 mod.
- Name lists get generated for each of the converted empires, but all the actual humans get their names from the default human name list instead. The only way around this would be to create separate human species with different name lists - but then humans don't recognize each other as the same species. To get around this, a few lines were put in the backstory about mass migrations breaking down ethno-national boundaries. This makes more sense for freedom-loving democracies than for lebensraum-dominating fascist states - but then maybe the ideals of the Reich got a bit lost-in-translation over hundreds of years.
- No converter frontend support. This is allegedly simple, so I'll look into it when I can.
- Megacampaigns starting from Imperator: Rome have not been tested.
- It's recommended to play with a higher hyperlane density, as converted empires can get blocked quite easily otherwise.
- DEFCON to Stellaris conversion exists, however it looks like the DEFCON to HoI4 converter isn't working.

Variable Earth Climates - This doesn't seem to exist on the Steam Workshop anymore.
